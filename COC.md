# dpc's code of conduct

Note: This is not a legal document.

During my professional and Open Source work, I am committed to the following
rules:

* Be nice and respect other people.
* Use polite language.
* Judge technical problems and solutions, not people.
* Treat everyone fairly.
* In case of disagreement use arbitrage of position of authority and
  responsibility (eg. project owner).

I expect other people to follow these rules as well.
